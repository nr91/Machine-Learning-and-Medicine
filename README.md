# Machine Learning Projects

### About me
I am an aspiring dermatologist with a background in engineering and a passion for machine learning. I believe machine learning has the ability to augment the doctor-patient relationship and enable physicians to deliver better, more personalized care. In this repo, I present several projects with machine learning applications in medicine.

### Projects
* **Entity Embeddings for representing features of Dermatological Diseases** - Application of entity embeddings, an alternative way of representing categorical variables, towards clinical and histopathological data from several dermatological conditions

* **Breast Cancer Classification** - Neural network for classifying breast masses as benign or malignant based on cytopathological data obtained from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. Â
